# AUTOMATIC MAPPING OF ROADS FROM SATELLITE DATA USING DEEP LEARNING

## Overview

The Road Extraction project is designed to detect and extract roads from satellite imagery using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust model that can accurately identify and delineate roads, which is essential for various applications in urban planning, navigation systems, and geographic information systems (GIS).

## Objectives

- **Develop and Implement Deep Learning Models**: Focus on models optimized for semantic segmentation to identify and map road networks.
- **Enhance Model Performance**: Utilize techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and transfer learning.
- **Process and Analyze Geospatial Data**: Align satellite imagery with GIS data and handle various data formats.

## Installation

To get started with the Road Extraction project, you'll need to have Python installed. You can set up your environment by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IshitaSingh-28/Road-Extraction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Road-Extraction
    ```

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing includes satellite images with annotated road segments. Ensure that you have the data in the following format:

- **Images**: TIFF or JPEG files.
- **Annotations**: Binary masks where roads are marked.

## Model

The project uses a U-Net architecture for road extraction, trained with TensorFlow and Keras. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify road segments from satellite imagery.

For detailed information on the model architecture, training process, and hyperparameters, refer to the `model.py` and `train.py` files.

## Results

The road extraction results are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Example results can be found in the notebook and the `results` directory.
