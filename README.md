# AUTOMATIC MAPPING OF ROADS FROM SATELLITE DATA USING DEEP LEARNING

## Overview

The Road Extraction project is designed to detect and extract roads from satellite imagery using advanced image processing and Deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust model that can accurately identify and delineate roads, which is essential for various applications in urban planning, navigation systems, and geographic information systems (GIS).

## Installation

To get started with the Road Extraction project, you'll need to have Python installed. You can set up your environment by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IshitaSingh-28/Road-Extraction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Road-Extraction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can use the provided scripts to train the model or perform road extraction on new images.

### Training the Model

To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py --dataset_path <path_to_dataset> --output_dir <path_to_output>
```

### Road Extraction

To extract roads from a new satellite image, use:
```bash
python extract_roads.py --image_path <path_to_image> --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --output_dir <path_to_output>
```

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing includes satellite images with annotated road segments. Ensure that you have the data in the appropriate format as specified in the `data_preparation.py` script.

## Model

The project uses [model_name] for road extraction, which is trained using [specific techniques or frameworks, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, TensorFlow, PyTorch]. For detailed information on the model architecture and training procedure, refer to the `model.py` and `train.py` files.

## Results

The results of the road extraction are evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Example results can be found in the `results` directory.
